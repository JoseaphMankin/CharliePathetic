								<h4>Dr. Ska-Core or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Find Out That Punks In Fact Do Shower Sometimes</h4>
								<p><b>By Dan Walker</b></p>
								<p><b>Prologue</b></p>
								<p>
										The year was one-thousand, nine-hundred, ninety-nine. The band I was in, Charlie Pathetic (CP), had enjoyed some mild tristate successes over a couple years. Merch always moved. Fans were starting to bring their friends. We were beginning to realize that this thing could actually, ya know, go somewhere. Maybe not super-stardom, but had real potential for us to be less concerned about landing that 'great' day-job thingy, at least for a time... I found it boggling that 20 somethings could think realistically.
										We needed a professional recording done at a studio with a reputation. We produced demos and press kits DIY. We could've done it at Colorado's Blasting Room (affiliated with the Descendants and NOFX), but the drummer for The Lillingtons had an in with Screeching Weasel's studio- The Sonic Iguana. Hard to tell if we would've gotten the time of day anywhere else, anyway. Thing is, the Iguana is in frickin' Indiana. The one stipulation was that we record one specific track (Punk Rock Beauty Queen), as the studio pretty much only records straight punk outfits.
										We had already started planning a tour for the next summer. After a near-death experience travelling to Casper involving way too many cars and another in Nebraska (you will learn later that Nebraska has it out for me) where my drums got stranded (another common theme you will discover) in the trumpet player's car after some yokel pulled it out of a snow bank by the radiator, the tour vehicle topic was raised with greater frequency.
										At this point in the story, it would be criminal negligence not to mention Edward S Hays and his enormous contributions, musicianship, and friendship throughout our endeavors. It's an honor, sir!
										I had no resources at the time to get a vehicle, so left it up to wiser folks. I am the drummer, after all. Remember that.
										I feel the rambling coming on, so I'm going to take five before beginning part I of our story.
										Ok. Where were we? Oh ya- our communal transportation. And fart collector.
										I should also take this brief moment to give my parents their due. At this time in my life, I was NOT fiscally responsible. They held my hand through all of this and allowed me to pursue a lifestyle that I couldn't maintain (can anyone?). I'm surprised I wasn't fed to the Sarlac.
										The bus.....
										No, The CP Bus.
								</p>
								<p><b>Part I: The Charlie Pathetic Experience...or adventure...or whatever...</b></p>
									<p>	
										Our dilemma was getting from point A(Laramie) to points B(wherever). Together. In one piece. With a bunch of expensive equipment. Without killing each other. Ready to Rock. Eventually on busy city streets. With a bunch of young guys who didn't know what being a man was about. In a bus. With entertainment. Did I mention none of us had a CDL? Didn't need one, though. 
										It seemed hopeless, but a benefactor (who shall remain nameless) found an old 42 passenger school bus in Idaho that belonged to a relation of a very troubled individual that happened to have a terminal prison sentence (don’t ask). So, we went and got it. All we had to do is clean it out, and it was ours, as far as I knew. There was all manner of rotting biological nastiness in there. Who better than a few dumb kids to clean it out? The seats were gone and it was used for storage. While we were cleaning out boxes, something caught my eye. In one of the boxes, there was an un-fired LAW rocket launcher- I shit you not. I was getting ready to stow said ordinance and was told,
										'No fucking rocket launchers'.
										Bummer. What better to fire off at the end of a good set?
										There was a funny smell in the bus, a TON of mouse turds (that's important), but we didn't care, and we had a stripped bus ready for remodeling. This turned out to be one of the worst health scares of my best friend's life. There were three of us retrieving the bus. It was cold, and we drove hard. We didn’t use the heater after discovering, the hard way, that the vents were emitting a Satanic spore. Rotating drivers, the other two of us danced around and tried to avoid the nastier parts of the floor, as there was only one seat. The one you drive from. 
										My best friend was AWOL for a couple days after returning to Laramie and the other two of us had flu-like symptoms. It felt like we were breathing particulates. I heard back from the missing friend and he was really sick. I mentioned that it might be the Hanta Virus (mouse turds)- and he freaked out. He called the hospital and they said that if that's what he had, all they could do was make him comfy. Oops- good thing we’re friends. Turns out, we just breathed too much dust and old turd fumes. We called it the Rayda Bus Virus (RBV). Imagine every time you take a breath and feeling like you’re inhaling chalk dust that tastes and smells like rotting, burnt meat. With athlete’s foot. We smelled ass and feet for weeks. Molecular biologists would be envious of our nuclear holocaust bus cleaning regiment.
										The remodeling went well. We built whatever we needed with some help from carpenter/engineer friends. 2x4s are your friend. My Grandpa thought we were crazy, but donated some time, discount paint, and tools. You could tell he was ready to spring into action for a trip to the ER. He was especially vigilant of our circular-saw operation (ask my Dad, he’s seen the way I play fast and loose with power tools- think Homer Simpson). 
										Just inside of the bus’s emergency exit, we made plenty of storage for our gear. Locking cabinets, tie-downs, and shelves- we really WEREN’T fucking around. I think we managed to get 4 or 5 bunks bolted to the frame in front of sound-weapon storage. Too bad there were 9 of us. Kids, remember? 
										Got a futon couch to chill on. A few camp chairs rounded out the seating. Seat belt laws? Whatever. We scavenged carpet remnants to cover everything but the middle runway that no one but 8-year-olds can walk down. Since this was a tour bus/motor home- TV, movies, video games, refrigerator, stereo- all that stuff was necessity, dammit. Got an AC/DC converter, power strips, and figured one extra battery would do the trick (fire hazard much?). There was plenty of room in the engine compartment for at least two more (the bus only had a 350, which will be important later). Installing the second battery went well until a wrench was dropped and happened to touch both contacts. The wrench MELTED and fried the battery. Wasn’t me, this time. No one was hurt. Everything wired up right, though, and worked after a new battery (citation needed). We painted the bus blaze orange and black, as we had a fetish for using orange construction pylons and signage (legally obtained, of course) for stage gimmickry. We were ready to go
										Some of us had girlfriends and great fans and friends who gave us a send off. Some of the gals dressed up as Lolita-Catholic-school-girls and we drove by the dorms to say goodbye to Laramie. We dropped the people off who needed to get back to reality and headed down the road. We were stoked. Too bad things were about to spiral out of our control.
										Bus drove fine. The previous owner told us to keep it at 65, or ‘things’ might happen, no problem (engine too small for the vehicle rears its ugly head). It’s 1100 odd miles to Lafayette, IN and we had to make it in two days, which wasn’t a problem because we had a penthouse on wheels that we could camp in- 17 hours, no problem. Around Sydney, NE, there was a driver switch. At the time, I didn’t have a valid license, due to legal mumbo-jumbo out of my control. The only other person willing to drive couldn’t drive a stick-shift. I taught him to run the pedals, I ran the shifter. No cruise control, he eventually wasn’t paying attention. Overnight driving, and all.
										Before the first exit to Ogallala, smoke exploded out of the hood. It was 9 PM-ish. I looked at the speedo and it said 75. Shit. Anti-freeze mixed with oil. We pulled over. In the age without prolific cellphones, someone finally notified the cops, and we were going to be rescued. Freakouts ensued. A kindly owner/operator, Big Mike from Blue Bunny Trucking, stopped and picked some of us up. My drums wouldn’t fit. The drums stayed on the bus to be towed, and stranded (I was devastated- what kind of drum molester was going to ogle my babies?). Four of nine continued on, or we wouldn’t make it in time. Drummer has to record first, so I got on the road. We left our colleagues, not knowing where we would meet again. Mike dropped us off at a truck-stop in Ogallala, regaling us with tales of the road, and a request to mention him in any future liner notes. Still workin’ on it, dude!
										We stayed overnight, in a crap lounge where you can stay- but not sleep, with some other wanderlust dude scratching his nutsack (who I didn’t know at the time I would smell worse than in a few hours), watching goddamn Pokemon until the local Greyhound ticket office opened. 
										I officially joined the ranks of the Transient. It was hard to stay awake. I hate the Greyhound. We eventually got tickets somehow, and were off to Omaha. I still didn’t know where everyone else was. Don’t forget my drums. That bus-ride was quasi-intolerable. Some good-looking skanks were riding, though. Lots of sleeping/boredom happened.
										On reaching Omaha mid-day, arrival at one of the most rundown Greyhound stations I’ve ever seen, there were people we recognized. They were rejoicing around a grey minivan from the ‘80s when they saw us. I was never happier to see my brothers-in-arms. Someone had minerals enough to rent a beater. They had a cooler with our food, gas money, and the all-too-real notion that we were far behind. Not having a mobile phone, this was nothing short of a miracle. Lesser (smarter) folks would’ve went home…

										<p><b>Part II: Out of Our Element</b></p>
										By this point, we were road-weary, tired, scared, and so jazzed on adrenaline that we didn’t care. All we talked about was band shit. Touring, writing songs, stage presence, money, a headquarters, not dying, Britney Spears…
										I guess I should mention that the initial trip only consisted of 7 of us. Two horn players had official performances that they couldn’t miss for their music degrees. A factoid I unintentionally omitted, trying to remember all this crap. That adventure is forthcoming, I promise.
										There won’t be much talk of scenery and the like, as I was freaked out and too obsessed with our final destination to care. Besides, I was already well on my way to augmenting my carbon footprint to talk about touchy-feely-
										being-one-with-nature. Or some crap.
										When the adrenaline started to wear off, we realized if we didn’t hurry the hell up, we would lose the deposit and go home without recording. It was made clear by the studio that punctuality was extremely important. The despair was palpable. We didn’t stop for anything but gas. Pee breaks were limited. I was starting to second guess this whole operation through the hangover of our major setbacks and tensions were mounting between us all as happens on any road trip. Expectations of your fellow traveler weren’t met. Everyone had their own idea of how to handle shit. Someone wanted Subway but everyone else wanted Arby’s- that sort of thing. A fart would have set off a powder keg. Damn kids. It was pretty quiet for a few hours.
										I tried to sleep as much as possible cause we were going to be at the studio in the middle of the night, assuming we could find the damn place in the dark, and I had to be up and ready to go by 9. I think I got 2 hours sleep before recording. There was the issue of the drums and we called ahead to see if the studio could help us out. I don’t think they charged us because a local drummer kindly lent me his rig. Mass (the producer/owner) knew we would be late and was accommodating. 
										We got to the studio and were awestruck by being in the same place as some of our favorite bands. One of the booths has CDs (what are those?) produced there in nice frames all over the walls. If you’re familiar with Screeching Weasel’s- Count To Three, the count off is 8 glass bottles being broken against a wall. That was recorded literally right where we stood when shown the storage room. The shear amount of gear in that place was amazing. I couldn’t take it in until the next day. We grabbed a bite. Mass gave us a tour. The studio has a pretty swanky apartment on the second floor so you’re on site the whole time (which has its downsides). I think Mass and Lumley (drum tech) were skeptical about the sleeping arrangements as there was one hide-a-bed and a few cots. But, we’re from Wyoming! Never forget your sleeping bag (or your towel). We all had our ‘shaving kits’, but the studio had bought a case of Irish Spring soap for us. I think it was a not-so-subtle hint that no one wanted to smell dirty teenage funk. After getting acquainted a little better, watching some questionable and disgusting stuff on the interwebs, and sufficiently putting Mass at ease with 7 party kids crashing at his place of business, I headed to bed. Nap would be more appropriate.
